28433 * 2**7830457 + 1

Find the last ten digits of this prime number.

last 10 digits
-> mod (10**10)


ending m digits of the positive powers of two repeat in cycles; 
specifically, cycles of length 4·5**(m-1), starting at 2**m. 

Powers of two that differ in their exponents by 4·5**(m-1) have the same ending m digits.



2**10 ~~ 2**(10 + 4*5**(10-1))

cycle = 4*5**(10-1) 



p2 = 2**(7830457 + 10 - (10 + cycle)) % (10**10)


res = (28433*p2+1) % (10**10)
